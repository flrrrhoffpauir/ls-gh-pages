LIVESTRONG Foundation

You are stronger than you know.

We know this is a scary time, but you are a strong individual. We believe in you. It’s common and normal to feel a wide range of emotions during cancer treatment. We are here to help you acknowledge the rage and accept the tears.


* A cancer diagnosis can cause feelings of confusion, anxiety and depression. We can help you face your fears.
