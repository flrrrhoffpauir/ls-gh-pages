LIVESTRONG Foundation

Dear Friend,

Here at LIVESTRONG, we strive to empower our cancer survivors with the information they need to live every second with every ounce of their being.

Knowledge is power, and we hope that we gave you useful information to use on your cancer journey. We will have more emails from our Navigation team to come!

Your input is vital to the Foundation. Your thoughts and opinions help shape our programs and resources so that we can continue offering the best support we can to people affected by cancer now.

Please take our survey (https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1916258/LSNavEmailSurvey?utm_source=outro&utm_medium=email&utm_content=link-1&utm_campaign=newly-diagnosed-nav-series), and let us know if these emails were helpful to you. What should we add? What can we do different?

And remember, LIVESTRONG Navigation is always here for you. Whether you have questions about your diagnosis, fertility, emotions or finances, we have your back. Call us at 1-855-220-7777.

LIVESTRONG,
Abby
